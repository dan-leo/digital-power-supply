The LM358 is different from ordinary dual opamps:
It is low power (the first one) so its supply current is low.
2) Its minimum supply voltage is 3.0V.
3) Its output goes to the negative supply voltage if its sinking load current is low.
4) Its inputs work well at the negative supply voltage.
5) It has crossover distortion.
6) Its max frequency for only half the max output voltage is 6kHz.
